However&comma; in the second part fo the semester marks will be awarded for code quality and style and in exercise 4 there is quite a bit of repetition which could be improved on. Think about reuse and making the code more general. The same functionality can be achieved without so many conditional blocks. I will talk about it in class as well.</td></tr>

<br> 
<br>Overall application [7/10]
<br>> good

<br>Utility 1 [9/12] match
<br>> nice complexity
<br>> layout could be improved
<br>> data are saved but cannot be brought back up
<br>
<br>Utility 2 [10/12] planets
<br>> layout a bit busy
<br>> functionality excellent
<br>> error reporting could be improved
<br>> close button would be standard
<br>
<br>Utility 3 [10/12] gravity
<br>> error reporting could be improved
<br>> close button would be standard
<br>
<br>User guide [7/10]
<br>> separate user guided&comma; while requirement was for one
