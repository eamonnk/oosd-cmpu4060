# Exercise 1 - Write a Python script that produces the following output on the console:

# **********
# *        *
# *        *
# *        *
# **********

# -- SOLUTION --
# Using print command to display square shape composed of asterisks
# and using \n escape sequence to wrap to a new line to allow 
# it is done on a single line to allow it execute in a single print function 
# rather than multiple print commands, making it more efficient
print("**********\n*        *\n*        *\n*        *\n**********")
